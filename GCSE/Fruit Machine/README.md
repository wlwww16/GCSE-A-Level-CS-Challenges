# Fruit Machine
Write a program to simulate a Fruit Machine that displays three symbols at random from Cherry, Bell, Lemon, Orange, Star, Skull. 
The player starts with £1 credit, with each go costing 20p. If the Fruit Machine "rolls" two of the same symbol, the user wins 50p. The player wins £1 for three of the same and £5 for 3 
Bells. The player loses £1 if two skulls are rolled and all of his/her money if three skulls are rolled. The player can choose to quit with the winnings after each roll or keep playing until 
there is no money left.
