# Thief!
A thief has managed to find out the four digits for an online PIN code, but doesn't know the correct sequence needed to hack into the account. 
Design and write a program that displays all the possible combinations for any four numerical digits entered by the user. The program should avoid displaying the same 
combination more than once.
